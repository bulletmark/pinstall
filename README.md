## PINSTALL - Installer Tool for Python Programs
[![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pinstall)](https://pypi.org/project/pinstall/)
[![AUR](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/pinstall)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pinstall/)

This is a simple "swiss-army" tool to facilitate installing Python
programs on Linux systems. The following commands are presently
implemented, each as an independent [plugin](pinstall/commands).

The latest documentation and code is available at
https://github.com/bulletmark/pinstall.

## Usage

Type `pinstall` or `pinstall -h` to view the usage summary:

```
usage: pinstall [-h] {project,service,status,venv} ...

Installer tool for Python programs.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Commands:
  {project,service,status,venv}
    project             Creates a bare-bones Python pyproject.toml file to
                        facilitate installation by pipx or pip.
    service             Installs systemd services and corresponding timers.
    status              Reports systemctl status of services and timers
                        installed from the current directory.
    venv                Creates a Python virtual environment.
```

Type `pinstall <command> -h` to see specific help/usage for any
individual command:

### Command `project`

```
usage: pinstall project [-h] [-f REQUIREMENTS_FILE] [-o] [app]

Creates a bare-bones Python pyproject.toml file to facilitate
installation by pipx or pip.

Useful when you have an app.py and it's special package dependencies
specified in requirements.txt and want to install that app.py (as
command "app") using pipx or pip but don't have a pyproject.toml (or old
style setup.py). Run this command in the same directory as the files and
it will create a bare-bones ./pyproject.toml file. This will allow you
to install the app using `pipx install .`, or `pip install .` commands.

Your app.py must have a main() function to be called when the app is
run.

positional arguments:
  app                   app[.py] or app/ package to create pyproject.toml for.
                        If not specified then looks for a single .py file in
                        current directory.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f REQUIREMENTS_FILE, --requirements-file REQUIREMENTS_FILE
                        default="requirements.txt"
  -o, --overwrite       overwrite existing pyproject.toml file
```

### Command `service`

```
usage: pinstall service [-h] [-u] [-s] [-e] [-r] [units ...]

Installs systemd services and corresponding timers.

Substitutes template strings within each *.service file in the current
directory (and in any corresponding .timer file); installs the
substituted file[s] to the appropriate systemd system (or user) unit
configuration directory; then enables and starts the service (or the
timer).

Template strings can be any of the following:

    HOME      : Home directory path of the invoking user
    USER      : User name of invoking user
    USERID    : Numeric user ID of the invoking user
    GROUPID   : Numeric group ID of the invoking user
    WORKDIR   : Directory path of the service file
    PROGDIR   : Same as WORKDIR
    BASENAME  : Directory name of the service file
    PROG      : Stem name of the service file (i.e. "name" in "name.service")
    PROGTITLE : Upper case of PROG

Template strings are specified in .service and .timer files by wrapping
them in hash symbols. Installed copies of these source files have all
instances of template strings replaced by their value. E.g. #HOME#
gets replaced by the user's home directory path.

positional arguments:
  units            systemd service file[s]

options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -u, --user       install as user service
  -s, --no-start   do not start service[s]
  -e, --no-enable  do not enable service[s]
  -r, --remove     just uninstall and remove service[s]
```

### Command `status`

```
usage: pinstall status [-h] [-u] [units ...]

Reports systemctl status of services and timers installed from the
current directory.

positional arguments:
  units       systemd service file[s]

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -u, --user  report for user service
```

### Command `venv`

```
usage: pinstall venv [-h] [-d DIR] [-p PYTHON | -P PYENV]
                        [-f REQUIREMENTS_FILE] [-r] [-u] [-i [PACKAGE ...]]
                        [-w] [-W] [-v]
                        [args ...]

Creates a Python virtual environment.

Runs `python -m venv` to create a venv (optionally for the specified
Python name, or path, or pyenv Python version); adds a .gitignore to it
to be automatically ignored by git; upgrades the venv with the latest
pip + setuptools + wheel; then installs all package dependencies from
1) requirements.txt if present, or 2) from pyproject.toml if present.

positional arguments:
  args                  optional arguments to python -m venv (add by starting
                        with "--"). See options in `python -m venv -h`

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d DIR, --dir DIR     directory name to create, default="venv"
  -p PYTHON, --python PYTHON
                        python executable, default="python3"
  -P PYENV, --pyenv PYENV
                        pyenv python version to use, i.e. from `pyenv
                        versions`, e.g. "3.9".
  -f REQUIREMENTS_FILE, --requirements-file REQUIREMENTS_FILE
                        default="requirements.txt"
  -r, --no-require      don't pip install requirements/dependencies
  -u, --no-upgrade      don't upgrade pip/setuptools in venv
  -i [PACKAGE ...], --install [PACKAGE ...]
                        also install (1 or more) given packages
  -w, --without-pip     don't install pip or requirements in venv (i.e. pass
                        --without-pip to python -m venv)
  -W, --no-wheel        don't install wheel in venv
  -v, --verbose         verbose pip install (can add multiple times to
                        increase verbosity)
```

## Command `venv` usage with Pyenv

[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a popular tool to easily
install and switch between multiple versions of Python. So for example,
you can use `pyenv` + `pinstall` to easily test a Python program with an
older or newer version than your system Python.

E.g. Install Python 3.7 and then create a virtual enviroment (in the
current directory) using it:

```sh
$ pyenv install 3.7
$ pinstall venv -P 3.7
$ venv/bin/python --version
Python 3.7.17
```

Note in this example that [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
installed Python 3.7.17 because that was the latest 3.7 version
available (at the time of writing).

## Installation

Arch Linux users can install [pinstall from the
AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pinstall).

Python 3.6 or later is required and the [`sudo`](https://www.sudo.ws/)
program must be installed (to use the `service` command).

Note [pinstall is on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pinstall/) so just
ensure that [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is installed then
type the following:

```
$ pipx install pinstall
```

To upgrade:

```
$ pipx upgrade pinstall
```
